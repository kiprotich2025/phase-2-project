***Conclusion***
* The budget doesn't guarantee a higher revenue. This shows us wee need to be careful in how much we add to the budget because we can get serious losses.

* Runtime doesn't affect the ratings of the movie, people are more immersed with the content not he time it takes away

* Documentary, Drama and Biography are the genres with the highest average ratings. This means also that a lot of the voters enjoy watching this kind of shows

***Recommendations***
* Focus on movies with a runtime of 120 minutes or more, as they are more likely to have a longer runtime and thus more potential for a higher rating.

* Be sure to choose a movie with a budget of at least $100 million, as this will give you a good starting point for your movie.

* Keep a watch on the popularity of your movie (number of votes), as it can help you make sure it is a hit.

* Be sure to choose a movie with a genre that is not too popular (like drama, comedy, or romance), as it will make your movie more appealing to a wider audience. A well balanced movie can have a great success.
